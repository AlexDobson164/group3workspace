# Relevant Issues: 

## Correct Display of Data/ Application Testing:

> "[Robert Williams] was arrested last year on charges he’d taken watches from a Shinola store after police investigators used a facial recognition search of the store’s surveillance-camera footage that identified him as the thief." 

> "Prosecutors dropped the case less than two weeks later, arguing that officers had relied on insufficient evidence."

> "Williams’s case sparked a public outcry about the fast-growing police use of a technology that research has shown often misidentifies people of color."

In this case, the program that was developed to prosecute and protect the people of Detroit did not function properly, and thus led to a false arrest and, likely, a potential law suit. 

This case not only highlighted the shoddy testing that was done on the program, but also that the program was not fit for purpose in the first place. The program was deployed for active use, and used in criminal case, thus the program had passed the testing phase. 

Although this article paints the police to be the ones at fault, they were just using a sanctioned tool at their disposal, akin to the way Waterman's clients will be using our tool. 

This relates to us and our client as they handle sensitive legal and environmental information. If said information carries any illicit or illegal connotation, Waterman is required to report the potential offender to the police.

Akin to how the police treated Mr Williams, in the event that our program does not display the correct data, or even represents data in an unclear way, this could put our client and their customers in legal trouble. 

Ensuring that we test this program for display accuracy and data representation is one of, if not, the most important issue relating to our further development of the program. 

## GDPR:

Keeping our data safe is the prime concern for a lot of the general public, and that doesn't change when referring to our client or their users. 

Ensuring that data is being processed in a way that ensures good-faith and confidentiality (within the bounds of the program) is of the upmost importance, not just legally but also ethically. 

There are cases such as the Caimbridge Analytica Scandal in which data is blatantly being sold for nefarious, advantageous or monetary gain.
